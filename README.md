# tstdin

Timestamp your pipeline.

    $ (echo foo ; sleep 1; echo bar ; sleep 1 ; echo baz) | tstdin
    2031-04-07 14:20:03.952221 00:00:00.000003 00:00:00.000003 foo
    2031-04-07 14:20:04.952120 00:00:00.999902 00:00:00.999898 bar
    2031-04-07 14:20:05.953362 00:00:02.001144 00:00:01.001241 baz

For each line received on STDIN, it outputs:

- (1) the current date/time including microseconds
- (2) hours, minutes, seconds and microseconds since the start
- (3) hours, minutes, seconds and microseconds since the last line was received
- (4) the line that was received

â€¦ all separated by spaces.


If the time between the previous line and the current one took too long, the
(3) token will be output with color: red if it took more than a minute, or
yellow if it took more than a second.

Colors are automatically disabled if STDOUT is not a terminal, if `TERM=dumb`
or if either `NO_COLOR` or `TSTDIN_NO_COLOR` are set in the environment, but
see the `-color` and `-no-color` options.
